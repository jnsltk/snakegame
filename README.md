## Introduction
This project was created as part of the course 'DIT094 - Mini Project: Team Programming' where the purpose of the course was set as follows:

> The course introduces the students to the theories, concepts, and practices of project management and software development projects. The course focuses on project management, the process of creating software, the skill of programming, and working together as a team towards a common goal. <br> <br> 
The purpose of this course is to give the students an introduction to the project management area and the tools and techniques used to manage software development projects. The course introduces the students to the human element and discusses people, personalities, and dynamics and the way in which they have an impact on IT projects. Areas such as cost estimation, risk management, and project evaluation are also discussed. <br> <br> 
Students work on a project to create a software prototype and relevant documentation from a conceptual idea and specification. The project enables the students to practice and develop their skills in project management and to collaborate, communicate and take responsibility. The project requires the student to organize their work efficiently.

During the course we have worked in a team of 7 to develop a version of the famous Snake game. 

## Technologies Used
For our implementation of the game and for the development we have used the following technologies:
- Java
- JavaFX
- Maven
- git
- GitLab

## To run the game
The easiest way to build and run the game is by cloning the repository and importing the project to IntelliJ. After making sure that all required dependencies have been installed by Maven, the project can be run by running the Main.java file.
